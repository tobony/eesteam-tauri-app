SteamyCalc
Developed by Kiran Pashikanti <kpatvt@gmail.com>

Usage
Simply provide two conditions (quality, temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy) and remaining thermodynamic properties will be calculated. If there is any interest for other thermodynamic pairs (internal energy, etc.), those can probably be implemented upon request.

License
SteamyCalc is a full implementation of the IAPWS/IFC-97 Water and Steam tables written completely in JS and HTML.
